Recovery Kernels
================

Recovery kernels are used to handle error conditions during particle simulations.
In the absence of a recovery kernel for error condition encountered,
the simulation ends,
likely with no output generated.

Recovery kernels are specified via a :py:obj:`dict` whose keys are defined in
the :py:class`ErrorCode` class in :py:mod:`parcels.tools.statuscodes`
and whose values are recovery kernel functions.
Here's an example of using :py:func:`moacean_parcels.kernels.DeleteParticle`
as a recovery kernel for the particle out of bounds conditions:

.. code-block:: python

    from moacean_parcels.kernels import DeleteParticle

    # ...

    pset.execute(
        kernels,
        # ...
        recovery={ErrorCode.ErrorOutOfBounds: DeleteParticle},
        # ...
    )

.. note::
    If you specify only a :kbd:`ErrorCode.ErrorOutOfBounds` recovery kernel,
    it will be use at all of the boundaries,
    including the ocean surface.
    If you want to handle particles that go through the surface differently
    to those hitting the bottom,
    land,
    or the domain boundary,
    you should provide a recovery kernel for that condition via the
    :kbd:`ErrorCode.ErrorThroughSurface` key.
    An example of that might be having particles that reach the surface reflect
    back down into the water column in contrast to deleting particles that reach
    other boundaries.

Recovery kernels are not JIT-compiled when the :py:class:`parcels.particle.JITParticle`
particle class is used.
So,
they are not subject to the same restrictions on Python standard library modules,
:py:func:`print` function style,
etc.
as :ref:`ParticleBehaviourKernels` .
