Installation
************

The recommended installation workflow for the :kbd:`MoaceanParcels` package is:

#. Clone the code and documentation `repository`_ from GitHub

   .. _repository: https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/MoaceanParcels

#. Create a `conda environment`_

   .. _conda environment: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/

#. Activate the environment and install the package using the `"editable" install mode`_.

   .. _"editable" install mode: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#editable-installs

=======

Getting the Code
----------------

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/version%20control-git-blue.svg?logo=github
    :target: https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/MoaceanParcels
    :alt: Git on GitHub

Clone the code and documentation `repository`_ from GitHub with:

.. _repository: https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/MoaceanParcels

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:UBC-MOAD/MoaceanParcels.git

or copy the URI
(the stuff after :kbd:`git clone` above)
from the :guilabel:`Code` button on the `repository`_ page.

.. note::

    The :kbd:`git clone` command above assumes that your are `connecting to GitHub using SSH`_.
    If it fails,
    please follow the instructions in our :ref:`moaddocs:SecureRemoteAccess` docs
    to set up your SSH keys and :ref:`moaddocs:CopyYourPublicSshKeyToGitHub`.

    .. _connecting to GitHub using SSH: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh


Create a :program:`conda` Environment
-------------------------------------

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ for each of your coding projects
is recommended.
Assuming that you have `Miniconda3`_ installed,
you can create an environment called :kbd:`moacean-parcels` that
will have all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation for the package with the commands below.

.. _Conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/
.. _Miniconda3: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd MoaceanParcels
    $ conda env create -f envs/environment-dev.yaml

Alternatively,
you can use :file:`envs/environment-dev.yaml` as a guide for creating your own
environment description file.
All of the dependencies above the

.. code-block:: yaml

    # For code style & repo QA

line are required to use :kbd:`MoaceanParcels` with :kbd:`OceanParcels`.
Put them and any other packages you want in your environment file.

The dependencies below that line are required for various parts of
:ref:`MoaceanParcelsPackagedDevelopment`.
You will need them if you are adding new kernel functions and particle classes to
:kbd:`MoaceanParcels`,
but not if you just want to use the stuff that is already in the package.

If you decide that you need to add a package to your environment,
add it to the :kbd:`dependencies:` section of your environment file,
then do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda env update -f envs/environment-dev.yaml

to update your environment.


Activate Environment and Install the Package
--------------------------------------------

Activate your environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd MoaceanParcels
    $ conda activate moacean-parcels

Here we assume the environment is named :kbd:`moacean-parcels`.
You should substitute whatever name you used for your environment.

In the :kbd:`mocean-parcels` environment :kbd:`MoaceanParcels` is installed in
`editable install mode`_ as part of the conda environment creation process.
That means that the package is installed in a way that it can be updated when new features are
pushed to GitHub by simply doing a :command:`git pull` in the :file:`MoaceanParcels` directory.

.. _editable install mode: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs

If you are using an environment that you created,
activate your environment,
then install the :kbd:`MoaceanParcels` package with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd MoaceanParcels
    $ conda activate my-environment
    (my-environment)$ python3 -m pip install --editable .

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (moacean-parcels)$ conda deactivate
